# Increase storage space

See the [guide for administering your server](/self-hosting/guides/admin). In
particular, you can use the `ente admin update-subscription` CLI command to
increase the
[storage and account validity](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/blob/main/cli/docs/generated/ente_admin_update-subscription.md)
of accounts on your instance.
