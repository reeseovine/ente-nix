# Guides

If you've figured out how to do something, help others out by adding
walkthroughs, tutorials and other FAQ pages in this directory.

See the sidebar for existing guides. In particular:

-   If you're just looking to get started, see
    [configure custom server](custom-server/).

-   For various admin related tasks, e.g. increasing the storage quota on your
    self hosted instance, see [administering your custom server](admin).

-   For self hosting both the server and web app using external S3 buckets for
    object storage, see [using external S3](external-s3).
