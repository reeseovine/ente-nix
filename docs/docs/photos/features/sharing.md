# Sharing

It is easy to share your albums on Ente, end-to-end encrypted.

## Links

You can create links to your albums by opening an album and clicking on the
Share icon. They are publicly accessible by anyone who you share the link with.
They don't need an app or account.

These links can be password protected, or set to expire after a while.

You can read more about the features supported by Links
[here](https://ente.io/blog/powerful-links/).

## Albums

If your loved ones are already on Ente, you can share an album with their
registered email address.

If they are your partner, you can share your `Camera` folder on Android, or
`Recents` on iOS. Whenever you click new photos, they will automatically be
accessible on your partner's device.

## Collaboration

You can allow other Ente users to add photos to your album. This is a great way
for you to build an album together with someone. You can control access to the
same album - someone can be added as a `Collaborator`, while someone else as a
`Viewer`.

If you wish to collect photos from folks who are not Ente, you can do so with
our Links. Simply tick the box that says "Allow uploads", and anyone who has
access to the link will be able to add photos to your album. [Read more](https://ente.io/blog/collect-photos/)
