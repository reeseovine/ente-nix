# Family plans

Paid subscribers of Ente can share the storage with their family, **at no
additional cost** as you have already paid for the storage.

In brief,

-   Your family members can use storage space from your plan without paying
    extra.

-   Ask them to sign up for Ente, and then just add them to your existing plan
    using the "Manage family" option within your Subscription settings.

-   Each member gets their own private space, and cannot see each other's files
    unless they're shared.

-   You can invite 5 family members. So including yourself, it will be 6 people
    who can share a single subscription, paying only once.
