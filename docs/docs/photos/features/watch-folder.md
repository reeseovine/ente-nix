# Watch folder

_Automatic syncing_

The Ente desktop app allows you to "watch" a folder on your computer for any
changes, creating a one-way sync from your device to the Ente cloud. This is
intended to automate your photo management and backup.

## How to add Watch folders?

-   Click on the hamburger menu in the top left corner
-   Open the sidebar
-   Select _Watch Folders_
-   Choose _Add Watch Folders_
-   Pick the folder from your system that you want to add as a watched folder

## How to remove Watch folders?

-   Click on the hamburger menu in the top left corner
-   Open the sidebar
-   Select _Watch Folders_
-   Click on the three dots menu next to the folders on the right side
-   Choose _Stop Watching_ from the menu

# Tips:

-   You will get an option to choose whether to sync nested folders to a single
    album or separate albums.

-   The app continuously monitors changes in the watched folder, such as the
    addition or removal of files.
