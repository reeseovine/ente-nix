_Earn and Expand Your Storage_

Did you know you can boost your storage on Ente simply by referring your
friends? Our referral program lets you earn 10 GB of free storage for each
friend who upgrades to a paid plan, and your referred friends receive an
additional 10 GB with their subscription.

## How to Refer a friend?

On the Home Page:

-   Click on the hamburger menu in the top left corner
-   Open the sidebar
-   Tap on _General_
-   Select _Referrals_
-   Share the code with your friend or family

Note:

-   Once your friend upgrades to a paid plan, both you and your friend receive
    an additional 10 GB of storage.
-   You can keep track of your earned storage and referral details on _Claim
    free storage_ screen.
-   If you refer more friends than your plan allows, the extra storage earned
    will be reserved until you upgrade your plan.
-   Earned storage remains accessible as long as your subscription is active.

## How to apply referral code given by a friend?
