# Files not uploading

## Network Issue

If you are using VPN, please try disabling the VPN or switching provider.

## Web / Desktop

### Certain file types are not uploading

The desktop/web app tries to detect if a particular file is video or image. If
the detection fails, then the app skips the upload. Please contact our
[support](mailto:support@ente.io) if you find that a valid file did not get
detected and uploaded.
