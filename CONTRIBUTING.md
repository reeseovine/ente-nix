## Spread the word

This is perhaps the most impactful contribution you can make. Spread the word.
Online on your favorite social media channels. Offline to your friends and
family who are looking for a privacy-friendly alternative to big tech.

## Engage with the community

Just hang around, enjoy the vibe. Answer someone's query on our
[Discord](https://discord.gg/z2YVKkycX3), or pile on in the sporadic #off-topic
rants there. Chuckle (or wince!) at our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/enteio)
memes. Suggest a new feature in our [Github
Discussions](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/discussions/new?category=feature-requests),
or upvote the existing ones that you feel we should focus on first. Provide your
opinion on existing threads.

These might seem like small things, but it provides us energy. Knowing that
there is a community of people who care for what we are building.

## Translate

If you're interested in helping out with translation, please visit our Crowdin
projects to get started:

If your language is not listed for translation, please [create a GitHub
issue](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/issues/new?title=Request+for+New+Language+Translation&body=Language+name%3A+%0AProject%3A+auth%2Fphotos%2Fboth)
to have it added. It is okay to have partial translations. Once ~90% of the
strings in a language get translated, we will start surfacing it in the apps.

Thank you for your support.

## Document

The help guides and FAQs for users of Ente products are also open source, and
can be edited in a wiki-esque manner by our community members. More than the
quantity, we feel this helps improve the quality and approachability of the
documentation by bringing in more diverse viewpoints and familiarity levels.

See [docs/](docs/README.md) for how to edit these documents.

## Code contributions

If you'd like to contribute code, it is best to start small.

Each of the individual product/platform specific directories in this repository
have instructions on setting up a dev environment and making changes. The issues
and discussions (feature requests) labelled "good first issues" should be good
starting points. Once you have a bearing, you can head on to issues or
discussions labelled "help wanted".

If you're planning on adding a new feature or making any other substantial
change, please [discuss it with
us](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/discussions). Discussing your idea with us
first ensures that everyone is on the same page before you start working on your
change.

## Star

If you haven't already done so, consider [starring this
repository](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/stargazers).
