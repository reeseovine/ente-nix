## Welcome!

If you're new to this sort of stuff or coming back to it after mobile/backend
development, here is a recommended workflow:

1. Install VS Code.

2. Install the Prettier and ESLint extensions.

3. Enable the VS Code setting to format on save.

4. Install node on your machine `brew install node@20`. Our package manager,
   `yarn` comes with it.

That's it. Enjoy coding!

### Yarn

Note that we use Yarn classic

```
$ yarn --version
1.22.21
```

You should be seeing a 1.xx.xx version, otherwise your `yarn install` will fail.
